# ray-caster
A simple ray casting engine I'm building using two languages:
* Python, with pygame and numpy
* C++, with SDL for windows API support (basically the backend of pygame)

The python engine is way ahead of the C++ engine, as I started work on it first.
I will only be working on the C++ engine from now on. I may work on the python engine on request.

There is nothing to do in the map as of right now, you can only roam around really.
Apart from that, some bug testing / play testing is needed.
Thanks for reading this.
